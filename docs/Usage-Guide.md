## Android Users, We've Got You Covered!

1. **Install Termux:**
   - Dive into the Android world by first downloading [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest).

2. **Execute Android Script:**
   - Open Termux and execute the command `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install curl openssl -y`.

3. **Download Android Script:**
   - Download the Android script by running `curl -Lo jiotv_go.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/main/android.sh`.

   *NOTE: If the above link does not work, try changing your internet connection or DNS settings. You may also consider using a VPN.*

4. **Grant Executable Permissions:**
   - Grant executable permissions to the script with `chmod +x jiotv_go.sh`.

5. **Install JioTV Go:**
   - Execute the install script with `./jiotv_go.sh install`. The script will automatically download the latest binary for your device and install it.

6. **Start the Server:**
   - Start the server with `./jiotv_go.sh run`.

7. **Access JioTV Go in Your Browser:**
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

8. **Update to the Latest Version:**
   - To update to the latest version, run `./jiotv_go.sh update`.

## Docker Enthusiasts, Here's Your Shortcut!

1. **Install Docker:**
   - If you're a Docker enthusiast, begin by installing [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Run JioTV Go with Docker:**
   - Run the command:
     ```sh
     docker run -p 5001:5001 -v ./.jiotv_go/secrets:/app/secrets ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go
     ```

3. **Access JioTV Go in Your Browser:**
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

4. **Update to the Latest Version:**
   - To update to the latest version, run:
     ```sh
     docker pull ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go:latest
     ```

## Optional Customizations

- Want to specify a custom port or host? No problem! Simply pass `host:port` or `:port` as an argument to the binary like this: `./jiotv_go "host:port"`. If you are using the Android script, you can pass the port as an argument to the script like this: `./jiotv_go.sh run "host:port".

- Disable TS Handler by setting the environment variable `JIOTV_DISABLE_TS_HANDLER=true` before running the binary. This can help reduce the load on the server and decrease latency, particularly on low-end devices.

- Customize the path or folder for your `credentials.json` by setting the environment variable `JIOTV_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path` before running the binary.

## EPG (Electronic Program Guide)

- To enable EPG, set the environment variable `JIOTV_EPG=true` before running the binary. This will generate an EPG file at `/epg.xml.gz` for use in IPTV players. The M3U playlist will contain a link to this EPG file automatically.

- If enabled, the EPG file is scheduled to be updated at a random time during midnight.

## Proxy üåê

If you want to use a proxy, set the environment variable `JIOTV_PROXY` before running the binary. Examples include Socks5 Proxy (`socks5://user:pass@host:port`) or All Other Proxy (`user:pass@host:port`).

## Remote Deployment Made Easy

In cases where remote server permissions prevent the creation of the `jiotv_credentials_v2.json` file, follow these steps:

1. On your local machine, log in to JioTV Go to generate your `jiotv_credentials_v2.json`.

2. Configure the following environment variables on your remote server:
   - `JIOTV_SSO_TOKEN` - The `ssoToken` from the credentials file.
   - `JIOTV_CRM` - The `crm` from the credentials file.
   - `JIOTV_UNIQUE_ID` - The `uniqueId` from the credentials file.

With these environment variables set, the `credentials.json` will be bypassed, and your JioTV Go deployment will proceed smoothly. Enjoy the journey!
