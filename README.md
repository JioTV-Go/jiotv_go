## Usage Guide 🚀

### **Using JioTV Go Natively**

1. Start your journey by downloading the latest binary for your operating system from the [releases page](https://github.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/releases/latest).

2. For Linux/Unix users, grant executable permissions to the downloaded binary. Use the command `chmod +x jiotv_go-...`, replacing `jiotv_go-...` with the actual binary name you've downloaded.

3. Run the binary with `./jiotv_go-...`.

4. Fire up your favorite web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

5. To access JioTV content, click on the Login button and enter your credentials.

6. Choose from a variety of channels and embark on your live TV adventure!

7. If you're an IPTV enthusiast, you can access the M3U playlist by visiting `http://localhost:5001/playlist.m3u`.

### **Android Users, We've Got You Covered!**

1. Dive into the Android world by first downloading [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest).

2. Open Termux and execute the command `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install curl openssl -y`.

3. Download our android script by running `curl -Lo jiotv_go.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/main/android.sh`.

4. Grant executable permissions to the script with `chmod +x jiotv_go.sh`.

5. Execute the install script with `./jiotv_go.sh install`. The script will automatically download the latest binary for your device and install it.

6. Start the server with `./jiotv_go.sh run`.

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

8. To update to latest version, run `./jiotv_go.sh update`.

### **Docker Enthusiasts, Here's Your Shortcut!**

1. If you're a Docker enthusiast, begin by installing [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Run the command

   ```sh
   docker run -p 5001:5001 -v ./.jiotv_go/secrets:/app/secrets ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go
   ```

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

4. To update to latest version, run
   ```sh
   docker pull ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go:latest
   ```

### **Optional Customizations**

- Want to specify a custom port or host? No problem! Simply pass `host:port` or `:port` as an argument to the binary like this: `./jiotv_go "host:port"`. If you are using android script, you can pass the port as an argument to the script like this: `./jiotv_go.sh run "host:port"`.

- Disable TS Handler by setting the environment variable `JIOTV_DISABLE_TS_HANDLER=true` before running the binary. By disabling TS Handler, TS video requests will be served directly from JioTV servers instead of being served through the JioTV Go server. This will reduce the load on the server and will also reduce the latency. This is useful on low-end devices where the server is not able to handle the load and the video playback is laggy/buffering. But remember not to set this variable in remote servers or when using proxy as JioTV servers will block the requests due to different IP address.

- If you prefer a specific path or folder for your `credentials.json`, set the environment variable `JIOTV_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path` before running the binary.

### EPG (Electronic Program Guide)

- To enable EPG, set the environment variable `JIOTV_EPG=true` before running the binary. This will generate an EPG file at `/epg.xml.gz` which can be used in IPTV players. M3U playlist will contain the link to this EPG file automatically. You can also access the EPG file at `http://localhost:5001/epg.xml.gz`.

- If enabled, the EPG file is scheduled to be updated at random time during midnight.

### **Proxy 🌐**

If you want to use a proxy, set the environment variable `JIOTV_PROXY` before running the binary.

Example:

- Socks5 Proxy `export JIOTV_PROXY="socks5://user:pass@host:port"`
- All other Proxy `export JIOTV_PROXY="user:pass@host:port"`

### **Remote Deployment Made Easy**

In cases where remote server permissions prevent the creation of the `jiotv_credentials_v2.json` file, follow these steps:

1. On your local machine, log in to JioTV Go to generate your `jiotv_credentials_v2.json`.

2. Configure the following environment variables on your remote server:
   - `JIOTV_SSO_TOKEN` - The `ssoToken` from credentials file.
   - `JIOTV_CRM` - The `crm` from credentials file.
   - `JIOTV_UNIQUE_ID` - The `uniqueId` from credentials file.

With these environment variables set, the `credentials.json` will be bypassed, and your JioTV Go deployment will proceed smoothly. Enjoy the journey!

## Explore JioTV Go's Paths and Endpoints 🌐

### **Web Paths**

- **`/`**: The gateway to the Home Page, where your JioTV Go adventure begins.

- **`/play/:channel_id`**: Dive into the world of specific channels with ID `channel_id`.

- **`/playlist.m3u`**: Instantly obtain an M3U playlist for IPTV. (Redirects to `/channels?type=m3u` for your convenience.) Add `?q=<level>` where `<level>` should be replaced with `low`, `medium`, `high` or `l`, `m`, `h` respectively to set the quality of the stream. Default is `auto`.

- **`/player/:channel_id`**: Immerse yourself with the default player (Flowplayer) for Channel `channel_id`.

- **`/clappr/:channel_id`**: Experience the magic of the Clappr player for Channel `channel_id`.

### **API Endpoints**

- **`/login/sendOTP`**: Request an OTP to log in to JioTV.

- **`/login/verifyOTP`**: Verify the OTP and log in to JioTV.

- **`/channels`**: Discover the complete list of available channels.

- **`/channels?type=m3u`**: Effortlessly acquire an M3U playlist for IPTV. Add `q=<level>` where `<level>` should be replaced with `low`, `medium`, `high` or `l`, `m`, `h` respectively to set the quality of the stream. Default is `auto`.

- **`/live/:channel_id`**: Tune in to live TV with the specified channel ID.

## Dive into Development! 🚀

### Using Docker Compose

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Run the command

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   It will automatically reload the server when you make changes to the code. (_.go and _.html files).

   To run the server in background, run

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   To stop the server, run

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. Server will be listening on `http://localhost:5001`.

### Using Go Natively

JioTV Go is powered by [Golang](https://golang.org/), so let's get started! Here's how to set up and run the server:

Set `JIOTV_DEBUG=true` to enable automatic reloading on templates changes in views folder and to enable debug logs in console/terminal.

1. First, make sure you have Golang installed on your system.

2. Fire up the server with:
   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/jiotv_go
   ```
   You will need to stop and restart the server manually when you make changes to the code.

That's it! You're now all set to explore and contribute to JioTV Go. Happy coding! 🖥️👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Customize the Look with TailwindCSS 🎨

At JioTV Go, we use the versatile [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style our project. If you're eager to make some style enhancements, here's how you can do it:

1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your system.

2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Switch to the `web` directory by running:

   ```sh
   cd web
   ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```sh
     npm install
   ```

5. To keep TailwindCSS up to date with your changes in real-time, run the following command:

   ```sh
   npm run watch
   ```

6. Once you're satisfied with your style modifications, it's time to build the minified CSS file:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## Building JioTV Go from Source 🛠️

Building JioTV Go from source is a breeze! Follow these simple steps:

1. After cloning the repository,
navigate to the project's directory.

2. Run the following command to build JioTV Go:
   ```sh
   go build ./cmd/jiotv_go -o build/jiotv_go
   ```

This will create a binary named `jiotv_go` in the `build` directory.
