## Usage Guide 🚀

### **Using JioTV Go Natively**

1. Start your journey by downloading the latest binary for your operating system from the [releases page](https://github.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/releases/latest).

2. For Linux/Unix users, grant executable permissions to the downloaded binary. Use the command `chmod +x jiotv_go-...`, replacing `jiotv_go-...` with the actual binary name you've downloaded.

3. Run the binary with `./jiotv_go-...`.

4. Fire up your favorite web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

5. To access JioTV content, click on the Login button and enter your credentials.

6. Choose from a variety of channels and embark on your live TV adventure!

7. If you're an IPTV enthusiast, you can access the M3U playlist by visiting `http://localhost:5001/playlist.m3u`.

### **Android Users, We've Got You Covered!**

1. Dive into the Android world by first downloading [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest).

2. Open Termux and execute the command `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install curl openssl -y`.

3. Download our android script by running `curl -Lo jiotv_go.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/main/android.sh`.

4. Grant executable permissions to the script with `chmod +x jiotv_go.sh`.
  
5. Execute the install script with `./jiotv_go.sh install`. The script will automatically download the latest binary for your device and install it.

6. Start the server with `./jiotv_go.sh run`.

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

8. To update to latest version, run `./jiotv_go.sh update`.

### **Docker Enthusiasts, Here's Your Shortcut!**

1. If you're a Docker enthusiast, begin by installing [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Run the command 
     ```sh
     docker run -p 5001:5001 -v ./.jiotv_go/secrets:/app/secrets ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go
     ```

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5001`.

4. To update to latest version, run
    ```sh
    docker pull ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go:latest
    ```

### **Optional Customizations**

- Want to specify a custom port or host? No problem! Simply pass `host:port` or `:port` as an argument to the binary like this: `./jiotv_go "host:port"`. If you are using android script, you can pass the port as an argument to the script like this: `./jiotv_go.sh run "host:port"`.

- If you prefer a specific path or folder for your `credentials.json`, set the environment variable `JIOTV_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path` before running the binary.

### **Proxy 🌐**

If you want to use a proxy, set the environment variable `JIOTV_PROXY` before running the binary.

Example: 

- Socks5 Proxy `export JIOTV_PROXY="socks5://user:pass@host:port"`
- All other Proxy `export JIOTV_PROXY="user:pass@host:port"`

### **Remote Deployment Made Easy**

In cases where remote server permissions prevent the creation of the `credentials.json` file, follow these steps:

1. On your local machine, log in to JioTV to generate your `credentials.json`.

2. Configure the following environment variables on your remote server:
    - `JIOTV_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The `access_token` from your `credentials.json`.
   - `JIOTV_SSO_TOKEN` - The `ssoToken` from your `credentials.json`.
   - `JIOTV_CRM` - The `crm` from your `credentials.json`.
   - `JIOTV_UNIQUE_ID` - The `uniqueId` from your `credentials.json`.

With these environment variables set, the `credentials.json` will be bypassed, and your JioTV Go deployment will proceed smoothly. Enjoy the journey!

## Customize the Look with TailwindCSS 🎨

At JioTV Go, we use the versatile [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style our project. If you're eager to make some style enhancements, here's how you can do it:

1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your system.

2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
    ```sh
      npm install
    ```

4. To keep TailwindCSS up to date with your changes in real-time, run the following command:
    ```sh
    npm run watch
    ```

5. Once you're satisfied with your style modifications, it's time to build the minified CSS file:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

## Building JioTV Go from Source 🛠️

Building JioTV Go from source is a breeze! Follow these simple steps:
