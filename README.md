# JioTV Go

JioTV Go is a web application that allows you to watch Live TV channels. This project helps you to watch JioTV without the JioTV App. The project is currently in development and is made for educational purposes only.

Download the latest binary for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/releases/latest) and refer to [API endpoints](#api-endpoints) to use it.

## Usage

### How to use JioTV Go natively

1. Download the latest binary for your operating system from the [releases](https://github.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/releases/latest) page.
2. On Linux/Unix, Give executable permission to the binary. `chmod +x jiotv_go-...`.<br /> Here `jiotv_go-...` is the name of the binary file you downloaded.
3. Run the binary. `./jiotv_go-...`.
4. Open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser.
5. Login to JioTV by clicking on the Login button.
6. Choose a channel and start watching.

### Android

1. Download [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest)
2. Open Termux and execute `pkg install wget openssl -y`
3. Copy download link of `jiotv_go-linux-(arch)` bin file from [releases](https://github.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go/releases/latest). Choose your aarch, mostly arm64.
4. Execute `wget <link>` to download the file. <br />Here `<link>` is the link you copied in step 3.
5. Then follow [How to use JioTV Go (above)](#how-to-use-jiotv-go-natively) from 2 to 6

### Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. `docker run -p 5001:5001 -v ./.jiotv_go/secrets:/app/secrets ghcr.io/rabilrbl/jiotv_go`
3. Open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser.

### Optional Steps

- If you want to specify a custom port or host, you can do so by passing the `host:port` or `:port` as an argument to the binary. `./jiotv_go "host:port"`
- If you want to specify the path/folder for `credentials.json`, set an environment variable `JIOTV_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path` before running the binary.
- Currently, we do not use native DNS resolution. If you want to use native DNS resolution, set an environment variable `JIOTV_DNS=1.1.1.1` before running the binary.

### Remote Deployment

In cases where you want to deploy JioTV Go on a remote server, and if server doesn't have writable permissions to set the `credentials.json` file, you can use the following steps to deploy JioTV Go.

1. Login to JioTV on your local machine. This should generate `credentials.json`
2. Set the following environment variables on your remote server.
   - `JIOTV_SSO_TOKEN` - The `ssoToken` from the `credentials.json` file.
   - `JIOTV_CRM` - The `crm` from the `credentials.json` file.
   - `JIOTV_UNIQUE_ID` - The `uniqueId` from the `credentials.json` file.
  
> By setting above environment variables, the credentials.json will be ignored and the environment variables will be used instead.
